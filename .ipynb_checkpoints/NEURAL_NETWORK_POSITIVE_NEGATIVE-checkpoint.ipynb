Discussion: Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors The presence of tumor is confirmed. Estrogen (clone SP1, Ventana) and progesterone receptor (clone 1E2 Ventana) were performed using a multimer linking system on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. The results are as follows: Estrogen Receptor: 80% of in situ tumor cell nuclei show moderate average staining intensity. All positive and negative controls stain appropriately. Progesterone Receptor: 10% of in situ tumor cell nuclei show moderate average staining intensity. All positive and negative controls stain appropriately. Ancillary studies were performed on this case with appropriate controls showing appropriate reactivity. These tests may not have been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary, since such tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by Sacred Heart Medical Center Laboratory. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Extravasated mucin is extensive but appears to lack accompanying epithelial cells. No invasive epithelial cells are identified. The findings are most consistent with low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (my coll eagues Drs. Tan and Ji concur). Although histologic features suggest that the atypical epithelium is luminal, the small sample size and the extent of mucin extravasation indicate that close clinical correlation and follow-up are warranted to exclude the possibility of pseudomyxoma peritonei.
